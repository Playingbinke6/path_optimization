TO DO LIST:
- find a way to incorporate the size of the virtual bot when making pathing canculations
    + so that the sides won't hit any barriers
    + may have a problem with bot finding spaces that are optimal but it would get stuck in
        # ie: gets stuck trying to go between 2 poles

- find a way to make the fields out of image files
    + use dif in red and green values as values, G-R=value

- make a virtual bot to move through the field and find the optimal path
    + this is for testing
